# Porject Overview
I developed a web and mobile app using React, React Native, and Firebase. Both platforms feature user authentication via email and Google. After logging in, users access a tracking screen with an anticlockwise analog clock, a speed slider to adjust the clock's speed, and a share button to generate unique URLs. The web interface is styled with Tailwind CSS. This project showcases seamless user authentication, dynamic UI elements, and interactive features across web and mobile platforms.
